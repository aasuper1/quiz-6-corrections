### Question 2
###### This question just needed to initialize an array for up to 50 strings. The first option, the one I chose, initialized the array and set a value for the first index which wasn't specified in the question. The correct answer did not specify a value and hence was best. 

### Question 7
###### I think that the correct answer for this question is the second to last where it iterated through the array 10 times starting from 1 and added the squares to the array. The others all seem wrong even though they are marked correct. The first will throw an index out of bounds exception because it runs 11 times with only a size 10 array. The  one with the while loop does not change the value of i because it does not have an iterator. The last one that I also chose is wrong because it does not not have any values for the enhanced for loop to run through. 

### Question 9
###### This loop will replace the ith character with the corresponding one if you started from the other side of the array. This means that it will just flip the order of the array. 

### Question 14
###### When initializing a blank array, all the values are set to null. This means that referencing a specific element will return null not 0.
